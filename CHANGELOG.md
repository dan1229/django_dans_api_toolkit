## [Released]

### [1.2.0] - 2025-07-13
- BREAKING: API response structure has been updated for consistency and DRF compatibility.
    - `error_fields` is now always a dict (empty if no errors), never `None`.
    - `non_field_errors` is now always a list (empty if no errors), never `None` or missing.
    - Paginated responses always include all DRF pagination keys (`count`, `next`, `previous`, `results`) at the top level, defaulting to `None` if missing.
- All tests and downstream compatibility have been updated to reflect these changes.


### [1.1.2] - 2025-07-12
- Fixed: Paginated API responses now preserve DRF's top-level pagination keys (`count`, `next`, `previous`, `results`).
    - Ensures full compatibility with DRF clients, tests, and third-party tools expecting standard pagination structure.
    - Custom fields (`status`, `message`, etc.) are still included at the top level.
- This update resolves issues where `count` and other pagination keys were missing from responses, breaking some client integrations and tests.


### [1.1.1] - 2025-07-11
- `non_field_errors` are now always returned as a top-level key in API responses, matching DRF conventions.
    - They are no longer included inside `error_fields`. This ensures compatibility with DRF clients and old tests, and improves error clarity.

    
### [1.1.0] - 2025-06-28
- Improved error logging!
    - logging methods automatically pass exception data to logging handlers
        - No more need for manual `LOGGER.error(f"...", exc_info=True)` boilerplate in viewsets
- Enhanced error field parsing and message creation!
    - Added robust helper function `_parse_validation_error_message()` to handle different validation error types
    - Improved support for DRF ValidationError with `non_field_errors` priority
    - Better handling of complex nested error structures 
    - Custom messages now always take absolute priority over any error type
- As always - tests, tests, tests
- Added `detect-version` Github workflow for auto releases
